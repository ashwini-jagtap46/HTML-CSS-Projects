                <h2>Life Journey</h2>
                <p>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, MC (26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa (Albanian: Nënë Tereza), was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun who, in 1950, founded the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu (pronounced [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]) was born in Skopje—at the time, part of the Ottoman Empire.[a] After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta[b] was canonised on 4 September 2016. The anniversary of her death is her feast day.

                    After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[7]
                    
                    Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. She was praised and criticised on various counts, such as for her views on abortion and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorized biography was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of other books as well as films. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.</p>

				<h3>Early life</h3>
				<p>
					Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)[8][page
					needed] Bojaxhiu (Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]—Anjezë is a
					cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower" in
					Albanian. She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian
					family[9][10][11] in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North
					Macedonia).[12][13] She was baptised in Skopje the day after her
					birth.[8] She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised,
					her "true birthday".[12] She was the youngest child of Nikollë and
					Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).[14] Her father, who was involved in
					Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when
					she was eight years old.[12][c] He was born in Prizren (today in
					Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day
					Albania).[15][16] Her mother may have been from a village near
					Gjakova,[17] believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.[18]

				<h4>Spiritual life</h4>
				<p>
					Analysing her deeds and achievements, Pope John Paul II said: "Where
					did Mother Teresa find the strength and perseverance to place herself
					completely at the service of others? She found it in prayer and in the
					silent contemplation of Jesus Christ, his Holy Face, his Sacred
					Heart."[134] Privately, Mother Teresa experienced doubts and struggle
					in her religious beliefs which lasted nearly 50 years, until the end
					of her life.[135] Mother Teresa expressed grave doubts about God's
					existence and pain over her lack of faith: Where is my faith? Even
					deep down [...] there is nothing but emptiness and darkness. [...] If
					there be God – please forgive me. When I try to raise my thoughts to
					Heaven, there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts
					return like sharp knives and hurt my very soul.[136]
